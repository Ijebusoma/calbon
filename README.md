Here I  implement a mix of jquery and PDO for a form functionality. The jquery datepicker is used for displaying a popup calendar while user fills the form, 
Plain Data Object(PDO) for storing the data into the Database.
The form is a component of a booking system that helps a user make appointments switfly.*drops mic*
